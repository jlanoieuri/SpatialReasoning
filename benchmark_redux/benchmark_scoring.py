"""This module contains functions for scoring model predictions against correct answers using specified scoring functions. 
The main function is score_prediction, which takes a prediction, target, and list of scoring function names, and returns a 
list of Score dataclasses with the calculated scores for each function.

To Add New Scoring Functions:
1. Implement a new scoring function that takes a prediction and target and returns a calculated score (e.g., a float between 0 and 1).
2. Add a new case in the score_prediction function to call your new scoring function when its name is included in the scoring_function_name list.
3. Use the new scoring function in your task configurations by including its name in the scoring_functions list for a task.
